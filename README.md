# Foundations of Databases 
Foundations of Databases university project:

This is a project I had the opportunity to build with a group of 6 people.   
  
I learnt about:
- the Life cycle of an information system, 
- the requirement analysis, 
- the Database design and the Conceptual, Logical and Physical design. 
    
 
 We used:
 - Visual Studio Code as IDE,
 - Git for version control, 
 - PostgreSQL as DB programming language, 
 - JDBC as API to access the database with JAVA.
